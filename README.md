# COMS-4156-GarlicBread-Client
Client App for COMS 4156 Advanced Software Engineering Project (Inlcudify) offered in Columbia University during Fall 2024.

This is an Android application which consumes the Includify service residing [here](https://github.com/Aditi-Chowdhuri/COMSW4156-GarlicBread).
Although the service primarily targets the elderly and disabled user group, this app is meant to be used by the secondary user group of volunteers.
